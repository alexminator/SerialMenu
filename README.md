# SerialMenu
This is a simple menu to be displayed by the serial port, with a structure of submenus and execution of commands.
The project consists of turning on an RGB led applying different effects such as:
-Static on
-Stroboscopic effect
-Breathing effect
It starts from a main menu where you will choose which effect to apply to the LED and from there you access different submenus to select which color combination
the effect will be applied to.
For this project I used an arduino nano and an RGB led connected to pins 9, 10 and 11 with PWM capability to support the breathing effect.
As an extra in the stroboscopic effect, its frequency can also be modified.
